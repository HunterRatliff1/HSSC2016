## >> Languages Spoken at Home (Q16):
## Students listed the languages spoken in their home in decreasing order of 
## frequency. From these responses, five language variables were calculated: 
##   ML - Multilingual household
##   PHLOTE - Primary home language other than english
##   NES - Non-english speaker, meaning meaning english is *not* spoken at all
##   L1 - Primary language
##   L2 - Secondary language

    ML     = str_detect(Q16, ","),

## >> Gender Identification (Q17): 
## Students were asked to select one or more boxes describing their gender 
## identification. The options the were provided are as follows: 'Female', 
## 'Male', and/or 'I'd prefer not answer'. Additionally, students were allowed 
## to write in their own responses. For the purpose of analysis, all respponses  
## other than male or female have been categorized as "Other".
  mutate(Gender = if_else(Q17!="Male"&Q17!="Female", "Other", Q17)) %>%
  
## > Race/Ethnicity Identification (Q18):
## Students were asked to select one or more boxes describing their racial/
## ethnic identification among the options 'White', 'Hispanic or Latina/o', 
## 'Asian', 'American Indian or Alaska Native', and 'Native Hawaiian or Other 
## Pacific Islander'. Similar to the Gender identification question, respondants 
## also were given the option to write-in responses or select 'I'd prefer not 
## answer'. Given the survey's limitations on this question (e.g. combining the 
## ethnicity question with the race question, the social construction of race)
## these data were simplified into simple factors using the following heuristic:
##  1. If the Hispanic/Latina ethnicity was selected, the response was 
##     categorized as `Hispanic (any combo)` regardless of race
##  2. If white, black, or Asian was the only response given, the response was 
##     categorized as `White alone`, `Black alone`, or `Asian alone`
##  3. All other responses (including write-ins) were aggregated into `Other/2+ 
##     Race ID`
## The detailed Race/Ethnicity ID data are available in the "Demographics" table
