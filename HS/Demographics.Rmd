# Self-Identified Variables

A few lines about methods can go here... Shouldn't be that complicated or long

## [Q16] Languages Spoken at Home

Students listed the languages spoken in their home in decreasing order of 
frequency. From these responses, five language variables were calculated: 

* <b>ML</b> - Multilingual household
* <b>PHLOTE</b> - Primary home language other than english
* <b>NES</b> - Non-english speaker, meaning meaning english is *not* spoken at all
* <b>L1</b> - Primary language
* <b>L2</b> - Secondary language

```{r Fig03, fig.width=8, fig.height=5, fig.cap='Figure 3'}
df.lang <- Dems %>% count(ML, PHLOTE) %>%
  filter(!is.na(ML)) 

df.lang %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=PHLOTE, y=n, fill=ML, label=str_c(n, " students "))) + 
  geom_bar(stat="identity") +
  geom_text(stat="identity", position = "stack", size=5,
            color="white", vjust=0, hjust=1) +  coord_flip() +
  scale_fill_stata(name="Multilingual (ML)") +
  theme_ + labs(subtitle="High School (2016)") +
  labs(x="Primary Home Language Other Than English\n(PHLOTE)", 
       y="Number of Students",
       title="Languages Spoken at Home")
```

This can also be expressed in percentage format:

+ Households that **only** speak english: 
<code>`r percent(filter(df.lang, !ML, !PHLOTE)$n / sum(df.lang$n))`</code>
+ Households that **don't** speak english whatsoever: 
<code>`r percent(filter(df.lang, !ML, PHLOTE)$n / sum(df.lang$n))`</code>
+ Households that speak **more than one language**: 
<code>`r percent(sum(filter(df.lang, ML)$n) / sum(df.lang$n))`</code> 
(with <code>`r percent(sum(filter(df.lang, PHLOTE, ML)) / sum(filter(df.lang, ML)$n))`</code> of these households having a PHLOTE)

## [Q17] Gender Identification

Students were asked to select one or more boxes describing their gender 
identification. The options the were provided are as follows: **Female**, 
**Male**, and/or **I'd prefer not answer**. Additionally, students were allowed 
to write in their own responses. For the purpose of analysis, all respponses  
other than male or female have been categorized as **Other**.

```{r Fig05, fig.width=8, fig.height=5, fig.cap='Figure 5'}
Dems %>% count(Gender, GradeLvl, sort=T) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(GradeLvl)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=GradeLvl, y=n, fill=Gender)) + 
  geom_bar(stat="identity") + #coord_flip() + 
  scale_fill_wsj(name="Grade Level") +
  theme_ + labs(subtitle="High School (2016)", y="Number of Students") +
  labs(title="Students by Gender ID & Grade")
```
  
## [Q18] Race/Ethnicity Identification

Students were asked to select one or more boxes describing their racial/
ethnic identification among the options **White**, **Hispanic or Latina/o**, 
**Asian**, **American Indian or Alaska Native**, and **Native Hawaiian or Other 
Pacific Islander**. Similar to the Gender identification question, respondants 
also were given the option to write-in responses or select **I'd prefer not 
answer**. Given the survey's limitations on this question (e.g. combining the 
ethnicity question with the race question, the social construction of race)
these data were simplified into simple factors using the following heuristic:

  1. If the Hispanic/Latina ethnicity was selected, the response was 
     categorized as `Hispanic (any combo)` regardless of race
  2. If white, black, or Asian was the only response given, the response was 
     categorized as `White alone`, `Black alone`, or `Asian alone`
  3. All other responses (including write-ins) were aggregated into `Other/2+ 
     Race ID`

The detailed Race/Ethnicity ID data are available in the "Demographics" table

```{r Fig06, fig.width=7, fig.height=4, fig.cap='Figure 6'}
# counts by gender & race
Dems %>% count(Race, Gender, sort=T) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=Race, y=n, fill=Gender, label=str_c(n, " "))) + 
  geom_bar(stat="identity") + 
    geom_text(stat="identity", position = "stack", size=5,
            color="white", vjust=.5, hjust=1) +  coord_flip() +
  coord_flip() + 
  scale_fill_fivethirtyeight() +
  theme_ + labs(subtitle="High School (2016)", y="Number of Students") +
  labs(title="Students by race & gender ID")
```

```

```{r Fig08, fig.width=6, fig.height=4, fig.cap='Figure 8'}

# Pre & Post Test Scores

Among our Short-term Outcomes
**Objective:** Through content-rich questions on pre-and post-tests, 85% of
students will demonstrate knowedge gained - thus improved academic readiness.
**Objective:** Through content-rich questions on pre-and post-tests, 85% of
students will demonstrate increased science knowledge and preparedness for 
health professions.
