Although the High School camp had 100 registered students, a few were absent on
either/both the first or the last day. For this reason, our dataset only 
contains <code>`r nrow(Dems)`</code> observations (i.e. students). 

# District, School, & Grade

Students came from <code>`r nrow(count(Dems, School))`</code> schools in
<code>`r nrow(count(Dems, District))`</code> districts. The majority of students
were in 11th grade, as depicted below:

```{r Fig01a, fig.width=12, fig.height=10, fig.cap='Figure 01A'}
Dems %>%
  mutate(School = str_replace(School, "(HS)|(SFYWL)|(CP)", "")) %>%
  mutate(School = str_replace(School, "The", "")) %>%
  mutate(School = str_replace(School, "School", "")) %>%
  mutate(School = str_replace(School, " ", "\n")) %>%
  filter(School!="Kippe") %>%
  count(District, School, GradeLvl) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=School, y=n, fill=GradeLvl)) + geom_bar(stat="identity") +
  facet_wrap("District", scales="free_x") + 
  theme_ + labs(subtitle="High School (2016)") +
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle = 45),
        strip.background=element_rect(fill="#D2D2D2")) + 
  scale_fill_economist(name="Grade Level") +
  labs(x="", y="", title="Number of Students by School, Grade Level") 
```

This may appear decieving, because it's not clear that the majority of students came from AISD. This, however, is not the case:

```{r Fig01b, fig.width=8, fig.height=6, fig.cap='Figure 01B'}
Dems %>%
  count(District, GradeLvl) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=District, y=n, fill=GradeLvl)) + 
  geom_bar(stat="identity") + coord_flip() +
  theme_ + labs(subtitle="High School (2016)") +
  scale_fill_economist(name="Grade Level") +
  labs(x="", y="", title="Number of Students by School District") 
```

```{r Fig01c, fig.width=12, fig.height=10, fig.cap='Figure 01C'}
Dems %>%
  mutate(School = str_replace(School, "(HS)|(SFYWL)|(CP)", "")) %>%
  mutate(School = str_replace(School, "The", "")) %>%
  mutate(School = str_replace(School, "School", "")) %>%
  filter(School!="Kippe") %>%
  count(District, School, GradeLvl) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=School, y=n, fill=District)) + geom_bar(stat="identity") +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_ + labs(subtitle="High School (2016)") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Dark2") +
  labs(x="", y="", title="Number of Students by School, School District") 
```


# Self-Identified Variables

A few lines about methods can go here... Shouldn't be that complicated or long

## Languages Spoken at Home

Students listed the languages spoken in their home in decreasing order of 
frequency. From these responses, five language variables were calculated: 

* <b>ML</b> - Multilingual household
* <b>PHLOTE</b> - Primary home language other than english
* <b>NES</b> - Non-english speaker, meaning meaning english is *not* spoken at all
* <b>L1</b> - Primary language
* <b>L2</b> - Secondary language

```{r Fig02, fig.width=8, fig.height=5, fig.cap='Figure 2'}
df.lang <- Dems %>% count(ML, PHLOTE) %>%
  filter(!is.na(ML)) 

df.lang %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=PHLOTE, y=n, fill=ML, label=str_c(n, " students "))) + 
  geom_bar(stat="identity") +
  geom_text(stat="identity", position = "stack", size=5,
            color="white", vjust=0, hjust=1) +  coord_flip() +
  scale_fill_pander(name="Multilingual (ML)") +
  theme_ + labs(subtitle="High School (2016)") +
  labs(x="Primary Home Language Other Than English\n(PHLOTE)", 
       y="Number of Students",
       title="Languages Spoken at Home")
```

This can also be expressed in percentage format:

+ Households that **only** speak english: 
<code>`r percent(filter(df.lang, !ML, !PHLOTE)$n / sum(df.lang$n))`</code>
+ Households that **don't** speak english whatsoever: 
<code>`r percent(filter(df.lang, !ML, PHLOTE)$n / sum(df.lang$n))`</code>
+ Households that speak **more than one language**: 
<code>`r percent(sum(filter(df.lang, ML)$n) / sum(df.lang$n))`</code> 
(with <code>`r percent(sum(filter(df.lang, PHLOTE, ML)) / sum(filter(df.lang, ML)$n))`</code> of these households having a PHLOTE)

## Gender Identification

Students were asked to select one or more boxes describing their gender 
identification. The options the were provided are as follows: **Female**, 
**Male**, and/or **I'd prefer not answer**. Additionally, students were allowed 
to write in their own responses. For the purpose of analysis, all respponses
other than male or female have been categorized as **Other**.

```{r Fig03, fig.width=8, fig.height=5, fig.cap='Figure 3'}
Dems %>% count(Gender, GradeLvl, sort=T) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(GradeLvl)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=GradeLvl, y=n, fill=Gender)) + 
  geom_bar(stat="identity") + #coord_flip() + 
  scale_fill_wsj(name="Gender self-identification") +
  theme_ + labs(subtitle="High School (2016)", y="Number of Students") +
  labs(title="Students by Gender ID & Grade")
```
  
## Race/Ethnicity Identification

Students were asked to select one or more boxes describing their racial/
ethnic identification among the options **White**, **Hispanic or Latina/o**, 
**Asian**, **American Indian or Alaska Native**, and **Native Hawaiian or Other 
Pacific Islander**. Similar to the Gender identification question, respondants 
also were given the option to write-in responses or select **I'd prefer not 
answer**. Given the survey's limitations on this question (e.g. combining the 
ethnicity question with the race question, the social construction of race)
these data were simplified into simple factors using the following heuristic:

  1. If the Hispanic/Latina ethnicity was selected, the response was 
     categorized as `Hispanic (any combo)` regardless of race
  2. If white, black, or Asian was the only response given, the response was 
     categorized as `White alone`, `Black alone`, or `Asian alone`
  3. All other responses (including write-ins) were aggregated into `Other/2+ 
     Race ID`

The detailed Race/Ethnicity ID data are available in the "Demographics" table

```{r Fig04a, fig.width=7, fig.height=4, fig.cap='Figure 4A'}
# counts by gender & race
Dems %>% count(Race, Gender, sort=T) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(Race)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Race, y=n, fill=Gender, label=str_c(n, " "))) + 
  geom_bar(stat="identity") + 
    geom_text(stat="identity", position = "stack", size=5,
            color="white", vjust=.5, hjust=1) +  coord_flip() +
  coord_flip() + scale_fill_wsj(name="Gender self-identification") +
  theme_ + labs(subtitle="High School (2016)", y="Number of Students") +
  labs(title="Students by race & gender ID")
```

```{r Fig04b, fig.width=9, fig.height=4, fig.cap='Figure 4B'}
Dems %>% count(Race, Gender, sort=T) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(Race)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Race, y=n, fill=Gender, label=str_c(n, " "))) + 
  geom_bar(stat="identity", position="fill") + 
  scale_y_continuous(labels=percent) +
    # geom_text(stat="identity", position = "stack", size=5,
            # color="white", vjust=.5, hjust=1) +  coord_flip() +
  coord_flip() + scale_fill_wsj(name="Gender self-identification") +

  labs(title="Conditional Percentage of Gender ID by Race ID")
```

# Socioeconomic Indicator

Most measurements of socioeconomic status (SES) fall in to two categories: Proxy 
and composite measurements. **Proxy measures** measure only one dimension of SES,
such as income, wealth, occupation, or educational attainment. They are most
useful when the proxy is highly conserved, meaning that they explain a high
degree of the variance in other dimensions of socioeconomic status or social
mobility. Proxy measures are useful in their simplicity, but often fail to
account for the full scope of  SES. **Composite indicators** factor in multiple
variables that influence SES by assigning weights to each dimension. This
provides a more comprehensive indicator and simplifies multidimensional measures
into a single ranking system.

We estimated students SES by asking about their parents' **educational
attainment** and **occupation**. We gathered these measurements for both parents,
and by doing so could deduce other useful indicators (e.g. single parent
households) for further consideration. 

## Educational Attainment

A common proxy for SES is the educational attainment of a students' parents
([Oakes][Oakes]). Educational attainment is of praticular interest for us because of the
camp's aims, so this proxy will serve as one of our primary indicators. Students
were asked to identify the attainment of both parents individually, by selecting
one of the following seven options and/or writing in their own response: 

1. Some high school
2. High school graduate
3. Some college
4. Associate degree
5. Bachelor’s degree
6. Post graduate degree
7. Doctoral degree

A fair number of students chose to write in responses indicating less than *Some
high school* (e.g. elementery school, middle school, third grade), so an 
additional *Primary Education only* category was added in order to capture these
students.

```{r Fig05a, fig.width=8, fig.height=5, fig.cap='Figure 5A'}
Dems %>% count(Edu, PHLOTE) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Edu, y=n, fill=PHLOTE)) + 
  geom_bar(stat="identity", color="black") +
  scale_fill_fivethirtyeight(name="Primary Home Language Other Than English") +
  scale_x_discrete(label=function(x) str_replace_all(x, " ", "\n")) +
  theme_ + labs(subtitle="High School (2016)") +
  labs(x="", y="Number of Students", 
       title="Students by Parent's Educational Attainment") 
```

Comparing that to the 2014 census' [estimations][Travis Edu] of Travis County,
you'll see we're pretty spot on: 

```{r Fig05b, fig.width=8, fig.height=5, fig.cap='Figure 5B'}
edu.levels.census <- c("Less than\n9th grade", "9th to 12th,\nno diploma", 
        "High school\ngraduate", "Some college,\nno degree",
        "Associate\ndegree", "Bachelor’s\ndegree", 
        "Graduate or\nprofessional degree")
data_frame(
  edu=factor(edu.levels.census, levels=edu.levels.census, ordered=T),
  u = c(6.7, 5.9, 17.1, 19.7, 5.5, 28.6, 16.5),
  moe=c(0.3, 0.2,  0.4,  0.4, 0.2,  0.4,  0.4)) %>%
  mutate(u=u/100, moe=moe/100) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=edu, y=u)) + 
  geom_bar(stat="identity", color="black") +
  # scale_fill_fivethirtyeight(name="Primary Home Language Other Than English") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels=percent) +
  theme_ + labs(subtitle="Source: 2010-2014 American Community Survey") +
  labs(x="", y="Population 25 year and over", 
       title="Educational Attainment in Travis County") 
rm(edu.levels.census)
```

More importantly, we ought to consider that traditional applicants to medical
school are disproportionally from families with high educational attainment and
not relective of the general population. On account of this fact, it makes more
sense to adopt a better measure of SES than education alone.

## EO Scale

The *Association of American Medical Colleges* (AAMC) measues SES with a
two-factor indicator comprising of the highest education (**E**) and occupation 
(**O**) of either parent. This scale categorizes students into five categories
(EO-1 to EO-5) and has been demonstrated to be a robust method of identifying
students from a socioeconomically disadvantaged background (Grbic et al., 2015; 
PMID: [25629949][25629949]). More information about AAMC's methodology can be
[found here][EO scale], but the basic methodology is summariezed well in the 
picture below:

![][EO Visual]

We implimented a similar classification scheme, with a few minor adjustments.
First, unlike AAMC, we considered household with only one parent present. 
Additionally, if a student left the occupation blank AND the educational
attainment was a *Bachelor’s degree*, we assigned a EO-score of `2.5`. This 
seemed to be a fair compromise in order to avoid discarding these students'
responses and this adjustment only had an effect on two students once the other
parent's education + occupation was considered.

```{r Fig06a, fig.width=8, fig.height=5, fig.cap='Figure 6A'}
Dems %>% count(EO=str_c("EO-",floor(EO)), Gender) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=EO, y=n, fill=Gender)) + 
  geom_bar(stat="identity", color="black") +
  scale_fill_wsj(name="Gender self-identification") +
  theme_ + labs(subtitle="High School (2016)") +
  labs(x="", y="Number of Students", 
       title="Gender breakdown by EO-Level") 
```

Now compare that to the 2012 AMCAS applicant pool:

```{r Fig06b, fig.width=8, fig.height=5, fig.cap='Figure 6B'}
EOs <- c("EO-1", "EO-2", "EO-3", "EO-4", "EO-5")
data_frame(EO=factor(EOs, levels=EOs, ordered=T),
           n =c(20.4, 7.8, 19.0, 16.8, 24.8)) %>%
  mutate(n=n/100) %>%

# Dems %>% count(EO=str_c("EO-",floor(EO)), Gender) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=EO, y=n)) + 
  geom_bar(stat="identity", color="black") + theme_ + 
  labs(x="", y="Percentage of Applicants", subtitle="Source: AAMC",
       title="AMCAS applicants by EO-Level (2012)")
rm(EOs)
```

## Proprietary Scale

**To do:**

+ Explain what it is
+ Why it's useful
+ Limitations

```{r Fig07, fig.cap='Figure 7'}
Dems %>% ggplot(aes(x=EO.sum, fill=Edu)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth=1, color="black") +
  theme_ + labs(subtitle="High School (2016)") +
  labs(title="Students by EO Indicator & Parents Edu") 
```

# AP Coursework

**To do:**

+ What was measured
    + Types of classes
    + Taken/Planned
+ How it is presented
    + Percentage of students by course
    + Number of courses by student
+ Limitations of inference

## By Course

```{r Fig08, fig.width=8, fig.height=5, fig.cap='Figure 8'}
AP %>% 
  left_join(select(Dems, SID, GradeLvl, School, District, Gender, Race)) %>%
  rename(Course=AP) %>% filter(!is.na(GradeLvl)) %>%
  group_by(Course, GradeLvl) %>% 
  summarise(Have = sum(Have)/n(), Plan = sum(Plan)/n(), n=n()) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Course, y=Have, fill=GradeLvl)) + 
  geom_bar(stat="identity", position="dodge", color="black") +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", position="dodge", alpha=0.33, aes(y=Plan)) +
  theme_ + labs(subtitle=str_c("Darker bars = Have already taken",
                               "Lighter bars = Plan to take",
                               "High School (2016)", sep = "   ...   ")) +
  scale_fill_economist(name="Grade Level") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels=percent) +
  labs(x="", y="", title="AP Coursework by Subject, Grade Level") 
```

It's worth noting that these are percentage measuring samples of very 
different sizes (e.g. `r nrow(filter(Dems, GradeLvl==11))` campers were in the 
11th grade while only `r nrow(filter(Dems, GradeLvl==10))` & 
`r nrow(filter(Dems, GradeLvl==12))` were in the 10th & 12th grade, respectively).
A more detailed breakdown with the group sizes (`n`) is available in the table 
below:

```{r Table01, fig.cap='Table 1'}
AP %>% 
  left_join(select(Dems, SID, GradeLvl, School, District, Gender, Race)) %>%
  rename(Course=AP) %>% filter(!is.na(GradeLvl)) %>%
  group_by(Course, GradeLvl) %>% 
  summarise(Have=percent(sum(Have)/n()), Plan=percent(sum(Plan)/n()), n=n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(Have), desc(GradeLvl)) %>%
  rename(`Grade Level`=GradeLvl, `Have taken`=Have, `Plan to take`=Plan) %>%
  formattable(list(
    `Have taken` = normalize_bar("#ADD8E6", 0.2),
    `Plan to take` = normalize_bar("orange", 0.2),
    n    = color_tile("white", "pink")
  ))
```

> A simplified version of this table can be generated if we collapse the 
`Grade Level` variable:

```{r Table02, fig.cap='Table 2'}
AP %>% 
  rename(Course=AP) %>% group_by(Course) %>% 
  summarise(Have=percent(sum(Have)/n()), Plan=percent(sum(Plan)/n()), n=n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(Have), desc(Plan)) %>%
  rename(`Have taken`=Have, `Plan to take`=Plan) %>%
  formattable(list(
    `Have taken` = normalize_bar("#ADD8E6", 0.2),
    `Plan to take` = normalize_bar("orange", 0.2)
  ))
```

## By Student

Now that we've explored the overall AP coursework of the students, let's move on
to another important question that we might have. How many AP courses has the
average student already taken? This is highly dependent on thier grade level 
(because many AP courses aren't offered until later in high school), so we'll
create histograms by each grade level:

```{r Fig09, fig.width=8, fig.height=5, fig.cap='Figure 9'}
AP %>% group_by(SID) %>% summarise(AP.taken = sum(Have)) %>% right_join(Dems) %>%
  filter(!is.na(GradeLvl)) %>% rename(Grade=GradeLvl) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=AP.taken, fill=Grade)) + 
  geom_histogram(alpha=0.75, binwidth=0.9, color="black") + 
  facet_wrap("Grade", labeller = label_both) + #facet_grid(Gender~Race) + 
  theme_ + labs(subtitle="High School (2016)") +
  theme(strip.background=element_rect(fill="#D2D2D2")) + 
  scale_fill_economist(name="Grade Level") +
  labs(x="Number of AP Courses Taken", y="Count of Students", 
       title="Number of AP Courses per Student, by Grade Level") 
```

As we'd expect, it appears that the number of AP courses (i.e. the count) seems
to follow a [Poisson-like distribution][Poisson]. Perhaps if I get around to it
I might be able to create a negative binomial regression to model the number of
AP courses taken...
