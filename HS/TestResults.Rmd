# Objectives

These objectives were taken from the *Summer STEM Grant to Dell Med School
Reporting Matrix*. The matrix outlined nine objectives (see below) across three 
variables (i.e. columns). 

## In this report

+ **Objective #1:** Increase students’ interest in health careers as measured by post-survey
+ **Objective #2:** Improve students’ focus and interest in school
+ **Objective #3:** Improve students’ enrollment in STEM courses at their school
+ **Objective #4:** Improve the academic credentials of students applying to college
+ **Objective #5:** Increase middle and high-school students’ (especially minority and disadvantaged sudents') science knowledge and preparedness for health professions

# Test Results

First, let's compare the distributions of the pre-tests and post-tests. Later, we
can dive into the weeds by looking at the questions and individual student's 
imporvements, but to begin we'll consider the aggregate distribution of scores:

```{r}
df.pre  <- Test.Pre %>% group_by(SID) %>% summarise(Before = sum(isCorrect)/n())
df.post <- Test.Post %>% group_by(SID) %>% summarise(After = sum(isCorrect)/n())
```

## Before the camp

The distribution of the students' scores coming into the camp were around the 40's
(mean = <code>`r percent(mean(df.pre$Before, na.rm=T))`</code>, median = 
<code>`r percent(median(df.pre$Before, na.rm=T))`</code>; SD = 
<code>`r percent(sd(df.pre$Before, na.rm=T))`</code>), meaning that our "average"
student answered ~40 percent of the questions correctly. 

Of course, not everyone scored the average score; some outpreformed the aveage and 
some scored a bit lower. The figure below shows this distribution as a histogram &
density curve with scores on the x-axis. The relative height of each bar (or the 
curve) represents the higher proportion of students who earned that score. 

```{r Fig01a, fig.width=6, fig.height=4, fig.cap='Figure 1A'}
# Density + Histogram of percentage correct
Test.Pre %>% 
  group_by(SID) %>%
  summarise(Before = sum(isCorrect)/n()) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Before)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..), binwidth=0.06, alpha=0.75,
                 fill="grey") +
  geom_density() + 
  geom_vline(xintercept=mean(df.pre$Before, na.rm=T), linetype=2) + annotate("text", x=mean(df.pre$Before, na.rm=T), y=0, label="mean", vjust=-1, hjust=0) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels=percent, limits=c(0,1)) + 
  theme_ + labs(subtitle="High School (2016)") +
  labs(y="", x="Percent Correct", title="Pre-Test Score Distribution")
```

## After the camp

The distribution of the camper's scores after the camp were substantially higher 
than before, with the midpoint now hovering around the 80's (mean = 
<code>`r percent(mean(df.post$After, na.rm=T))`</code>, median = 
<code>`r percent(median(df.post$After, na.rm=T))`</code>; SD = 
<code>`r percent(sd(df.post$After, na.rm=T))`</code>). This, in turn, indicates 
that our "average" student has now answered ~80% of the questions correctly.

The figure below is similar to the last figure (`Figure 1A`), but this time it has
been constructed using the post-camp dataset. Clearly the strong right-skew 
indicates that most of the campers improved their scores by the end of the camp.

```{r Fig01b, fig.width=6, fig.height=4, fig.cap='Figure 1B'}
# Density + Histogram of percentage correct
Test.Post %>% 
  group_by(SID) %>%
  summarise(After = sum(isCorrect)/n()) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=After)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..), binwidth=0.06, alpha=0.5, 
                 fill="red") +
  geom_density() + 
  geom_vline(xintercept=mean(df.post$After, na.rm=T), linetype=2) + annotate("text", x=mean(df.post$After, na.rm=T), y=0, label="mean", vjust=-1, hjust=0) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels=percent, limits=c(0,1)) + 
  theme_ + labs(subtitle="High School (2016)") +
  labs(y="", x="Percent Correct", title="Post-Test Score Distribution")
```

It's important to note, this level of analysis only considers the *aggregate*
distributions of scores, and indicates little information about how individual
students' scores changed. In the following section, we'll look at these same data
matched in a pairwise fashon.

# Paired Student's T-test

> In essence, we're concerned with **how each students' score changed** after they 
attended our camp

In order to consider how individual students' scores changed during the camp, we'll
want to run a paired t-test. Recall that paired t-tests are simply one sample t-test
of the *difference* of the matched samples. This is represented by the following 
equation:

$$ Score_{∆} = Score_{post} - Score_{pre} $$

Running this test on our dataset (disregarding any unmatched pairs) yeilds the 
following results:

```{r ttest, echo=T}
# Run a paired Student's T-test (one-sided)
t.test(Dems$After, Dems$Before, alternative = "greater", paired=T)
```

Considering our benchmark for "improvement" is that a students' score improves 
(meaning `After - Before > 0.00%`), this test clearly indicates that there was 
indeed improvement. 

Perhaps this is more easily shown if we consider the underlying distribution that 
this test is testing: 

```{r Fig01c, fig.cap='Figure 1C'}
Dems %>% filter(!is.na(After), !is.na(Before)) %>% ggplot(aes(x=After-Before)) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..), binwidth=0.06, alpha=0.5, color="grey",
                 fill="blue") +
  geom_density() + 
  scale_x_continuous(labels=percent, limits = c(-1,1), breaks = c(-1, -0.75, -0.5, -0.25, 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1)) + 
  theme_ + labs(subtitle="High School (2016)") +
  labs(y="", x="After - Before", title="∆ Score Distribution")
```

Finally, we want to consider the effect size of this relationship. To accomplish 
this, we'll want to determine the Cohen's d ($\frac{M_{after} - M_{Before}}{Pooled Standard Deviation}$) which we find to be sufficiently large

```{r cohensd, echo=T}
# Determine effect size (Cohen's d)
cohen.d(Dems$After, Dems$Before, paired=T, na.rm=T)
```
